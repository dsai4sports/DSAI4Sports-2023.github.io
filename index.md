<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to DSAI4Sports 2023!</h1>

Sports analytics combines advanced analytics, domain knowledge and computational methods on sports data to generate 
insights and deepen understanding into the various aspects of sports. This includes predicting most likely event outcomes, 
identifying optimal strategies, understanding individual and collective performance, estimating player potential, etc. 
These insights were traditionally achieved through carefully designed statistical methods. But with the recent creation 
and availability of large-scale datasets, breakthroughs and new understandings have been achieved via the application 
of AI/ML methods. This includes using sequence modeling to determine optimal path trajectories with real-time sensor data 
from players/equipment, applying computer vision models to game footage to capture important events, or training large 
language models to summarize large corpus of game-related commentaries. Some sports have progressed to syncing these 
different modes of data to train multi-modal deep learning models.

Even with this progress, the majority of AI/ML applications are still nascent. The DSAI4Sports workshop aims to bring 
together interested researchers and practitioners at the intersection of AI/ML and sports analytics. 

We are excited to announce that DSAI4Sports workshop is joining force with [KDD 2023 Entertainment, Sports and Media (ESM) Day](https://kddconference-esmday.github.io/KDD2023ESMDay/).
We will offer a platform to exchange research ideas, identify research opportunities and challenges in 
applying AI/ML for sports analytics, engage in thoughtful discussions, and foster the development of a 
research community centered around this field. Both DSAI4Sports workshop and the ESM Day will take place on the same day (Aug 7th) and in same conference room (details to come).

## Call For Papers

The core topic of the workshop is on Data Science, AI, and ML-based approaches for sports analytics, covering a broad range of sports activities like football, soccer, volleyball, badminton, tennis, basketball, golf, table tennis, hockey, car racing, swimming, and e-sports. We invite papers that demonstrate AI/ML use cases in the following broad (potentially overlapping) categories:

* _Team sports analytics_: player interaction detection and tracking, team-based strategy identification and optimization, opponent strategy analysis, etc.
* _Ball centric analysis_: ball tracking and trajectory prediction, outcome prediction, etc.
* _Player centric analysis_: player health tracking, gait and pose estimation and evaluation, etc.
* _Non-player activities_: predictive or active forecasting of wear and tear of equipment (e.g. cars), automated sports commentary generation, automatic event detection and highlight generation using footage, audience/fan engagement strategies, etc.

The DS/AI/ML methods that address the above use cases span spatial-temporal data modeling, time-series analysis, computer vision, explainable AI, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, multi-modal learning and others. We welcome both industrial and academic papers submissions.


The submission to the workshop must be in maximum length of
4 pages, excluding references. Papers must be submitted in PDF
format, and formatted according to the [Standard ACM Conference
Proceedings Style](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primaryarticle-template/wbvnghjbzwpc). 
The review process is double-blind, and author names and affiliations should
NOT be listed. Papers will be evaluated on, but not necessarily limited to, the novelty, validity, and application impact.
Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop and listed on this website (non-archival/without proceedings). 
A small number of accepted papers will be selected to present during the workshop as contributed talks. 

Please visit **[this link](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2023/Workshop/DSAI4Sports)** for your submission. 

Any questions may be directed to the workshop email address: **kdd.dsai4sports@gmail.com**.
