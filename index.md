# Introduction
Sports analytics combines advanced analytics, domain knowledge and computational methods on sports data to generate 
insights and deepen understanding into the various aspects of sports. This includes predicting most likely event outcomes, 
identifying optimal strategies, understanding individual and collective performance, estimating player potential, etc. 
These insights were traditionally achieved through carefully designed statistical methods. But with the recent creation 
and availability of large-scale datasets, breakthroughs and new understandings have been achieved via the application 
of AI/ML methods. This includes using sequence modeling to determine optimal path trajectories with real-time sensor data 
from players/equipment, applying computer vision models to game footage to capture important events, or training large 
language models to summarize large corpus of game-related commentaries. Some sports have progressed to syncing these 
different modes of data to train multi-modal deep learning models.

Even with this progress, the majority of AI/ML applications are still nascent. The DSAI4Sports workshop aims to bring 
together interested researchers and practitioners at the intersection of AI/ML and sports analytics. 
We will offer a platform to exchange research ideas, identify research opportunities and challenges in 
applying AI/ML for sports analytics, engage in thoughtful discussions, and foster the development of a 
research community centered around this field.

# Call For Papers

The core topic of the workshop is on Data Science, AI, and ML-based approaches for sports analytics, covering a broad range of sports activities like football, soccer, volleyball, badminton, tennis, basketball, golf, table tennis, hockey, car racing, swimming, and e-sports. We invite papers that demonstrate AI/ML use cases in the following broad (potentially overlapping) categories:

* _Team sports analytics_: player interaction detection and tracking, team-based strategy identification and optimization, opponent strategy analysis, etc.
* _Ball centric analysis_: ball tracking and trajectory prediction, outcome prediction, etc.
* _Player centric analysis_: player health tracking, gait and pose estimation and evaluation, etc.
* _Non-player activities_: predictive or active forecasting of wear and tear of equipment (e.g. cars), automated sports commentary generation, automatic event detection and highlight generation using footage, audience/fan engagement strategies, etc.

The DS/AI/ML methods that address the above use cases span spatial-temporal data modeling, time-series analysis, computer vision, explainable AI, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, multi-modal learning and others. We welcome both industrial and academic papers submissions.


The submission to the workshop must be in maximum length of
4 pages, excluding references. Papers must be submitted in PDF
format, and formatted according to the [Standard ACM Conference
Proceedings Style](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primaryarticle-template/wbvnghjbzwpc). 
The review process is double-blind, and author names and affiliations should
NOT be listed. Papers will be evaluated on, but not necessarily limited to, the novelty, validity, and application impact.
Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop and listed on this website (non-archival/without proceedings). 
A small number of accepted papers will be selected to present during the workshop as contributed talks. 

Any questions may be directed to the workshop email address: kdd.dsai4sports@gmail.com.

![Zhutian (Zhu-Tian) Chen](./images/zhutian-smaller.jpeg)

**Zhutian (Zhu-Tian) Chen** is a PostDoc Fellow in the Visual Computing Group at Harvard University. His research is at the 
intersection of Data Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Augmented Reality. Specifically, he is interested 
in improving the game-watching experience of sports by using embedded visualizations. He has developed a set of human-AI 
systems that allow general users to efficiently visualize data into sports videos through natural interactions such as 
touch, speech, and gaze interactions. His research has been published as full papers in top venues such as IEEE VIS, 
ACM CHI, and TVCG, and received three best paper nominations in IEEE VIS, the premier venue in data visualization. 
Before joining Harvard, he was a PostDoc in the Design Lab at UC San Diego. Zhutian received his Ph.D. in 
Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
